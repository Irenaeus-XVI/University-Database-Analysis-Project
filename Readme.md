## Overview
* This project evaluates your proficiency in SQL, database creation, restoration, data analysis, and result reporting.
* You have the flexibility to choose any database for analysis.
* Examples and tasks are based on a hypothetical database named "UniversityDB."

## Tasks

# Database Creation or Restoration
  * Create a new database or restore an existing one.
  * Insert dummy data into it.

# **Data Analysis**
  * Write SQL queries to answer:
    - Count of students by department
      ```sql
      --a.Count of Students by Department:
      SELECT d.DepartmentName, COUNT(s.StudentID) AS StudentCount
      FROM department d
      JOIN student s ON s.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
      GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
      ```
      **Output:**
      ```
      DepartmentName	StudentName
        Art	                2
        Computer Science	  2
        Engineering	        2
        Mathematics	        2
        Music	              2
        Physics	            2

      ```

    - **Total enrollment by year**
      ```sql
      --b. Total Enrollment by Year:
      SELECT AcademicYear, COUNT(DISTINCT EnrollmentID) AS total_enrollment
      FROM enrollment
      GROUP BY AcademicYear;
      ```
      **Output:**
      ```
      AcademicYear	Total_Enroliment
        2021-2022	       3
        2022-2023	       9

      ```

    - **Average GPA by course**
      ```sql
      --c. Average GPA by Course:
      SELECT CourseID, AVG(GPA) AS Average_Gpa
      FROM enrollment
      GROUP BY CourseID;
      ```
      **Output:**
      ```sql
        CourseId	CourseName	           AvgGpa
            1	Database Management	        3.8
            2	Statistics	                4
            3	Organic Chemistry	          3.5
            4	Cell Biology	              3.9
            5	Medieval History	          3.7
            6	Shakespearean Literature    3.2
            7	Microeconomics	            4
            8	Cognitive Psychology        3.6
            9	Mechanical Engineering      3.9

      ```

# **Query Operations (Breakdown, Rollup, Cube)**
  * Write SQL queries to perform breakdown, rollup, and cube operations.

    - **Breakdown of enrollment by department**
      ```sql
      USE UniversityDB;
      SELECT
        d.DepartmentID,
        d.DepartmentName,
        COUNT(e.EnrollmentID) AS EnrollmentCount
      FROM
        department d
        LEFT JOIN
          student s ON d.DepartmentID = s.DepartmentID
        LEFT JOIN
          enrollment e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID
      GROUP BY
        d.DepartmentID, d.DepartmentName;
      ```
      **Output:**
      ```sql
      DepartmentId	DepartmentName	EnrollmentCount
        1	    Computer Science	            2
        2	    Mathematics	                  2
        3	    Physics	                      2
        4	    Engineering	                  2
        5	    Art	                          2
        6	    Music	                        2

      ```
    
    - **Rollup of enrollment by year and department**
      ```sql
      USE UniversityDB;
      SELECT 
        e.AcademicYear, 
        d.DepartmentName, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.StudentID) AS EnrollmentCount
      FROM enrollment e
      JOIN student s ON e.StudentID = s.StudentID
      JOIN department d ON s.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
      GROUP BY e.AcademicYear, d.DepartmentName
      ORDER BY e.AcademicYear, d.DepartmentName;
      ```
      **Output:**
      ```sql
